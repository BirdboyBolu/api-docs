# Get API Key

Let's start by creating an API key to your Sandbox workspace. Our Sandbox lets you test your code against simulated devices that behave like the real ones.

- Go to the Dashboard, and use the workspace dropdown to select the "Test" sandbox.
- In the left nav, click on API Keys.
- Click the "Add API Key" button in the top right.
- Give your key a name, then save it somewhere safe.

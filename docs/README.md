[Seam](https://getseam.com) makes it easy to connect your application with devices and control them!

We've integrated many door locks, thermostats, and other devices brands, and created simple APIs for interacting with them.

We organized our documentation as follows:

1. **Quick Start:** [The fastest way](quickstart/get-api-key.md) to your first API call! **<- Go here if you're in a hurry!**
2. **Core Concept:** Learn the core concepts that underpin our APIs.
3. **Device Capabilities:**  Explore the set of APIs we expose to each device.
4. **Device Guides:** Step-by-step instructions on how to link and control devices.
